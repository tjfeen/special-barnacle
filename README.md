## Research question and hypothesis
The research question of this paper is: how does language used by authors from different socioeconomic backgrounds differ?
Hypothesis: works of writers from a less fortunate socioeconomic background have a lower text complexity (shorter words, shorter sentences, less adjectives), compared to works from upper-class authors.

## Method
For this project, the database of Project Gutenberg will be used. The middle-class authors will be represented by Mark Twain, and the upper-class authors by Oscar Wilde.
